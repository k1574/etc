# etc
etc - configuration file control system.
## Installation
Environment installation files and scripts for it.
To install run: ``$ mk install``
Or: ``$ ./configure.sh``
Or: ``$ ./configure.rc``

After it config and dot files will be linked, so changing them the way like:
``$ vi $HOME/.profile``
will affect in this git repository so you can commit it and save.
The structure is supposed to be as simple as possible and scripts should be small.

### configure.d/dot.(sh|rc)
"dot/*" files are linked into home directory with '.' character concatenated in front.

### configure.d/lib.(sh|rc)
"lib/*" files arel linked with the same name into "$XDG_CONFIG_DIR".

### configure.d/inferno.(sh|rc)
Creates directory $INFRENO/usr/$USER and links inferno/lib into it.

### ... (I will describe it later if there will be need about it)
If some variables aren't set then script isn about to do nothing.
It's so to make environment setting painless.
